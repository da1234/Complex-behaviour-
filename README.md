# From Simple Games to Complex Behaviour

What connects Earthquakes and and 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'? They are both complex systems; a system with characteristics not possessed by its constituents.

In this project we simulate games of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' to see how a simple game can lead to complex behaviour. The system comprises of an n x n size square grid populated with agents, each of which competes in a round of the game with their neighbours using the Moore neighbourhood approach (8 neighbours). Once played, the grid system is updated to reflect the relative player scores.

Run the project and enjoy our colourful display!

## Example Simulation Snapshots

A randomly populated grid of 'Rock' (red), 'Paper' (green) and 'Scissors' (blue) stategies is shown below.

After a few iterations, the grid evolves to form bands of colours!

Feel free to experiment with additional stategies (eg 'Lizard', 'Spock' ...)!
